<h2>Reinforcement Learning Agent in Wumpus World</h2>

Instructions to run the Code from scratch:
    1. Install OpenAI gym (http://gym.openai.com/docs/)
    2. Packages to be installed: matplotlib, pandas
    3. Arrange qWumpus_without_percepts and q_wumpus_with_percepts in seperate folders
    
    ----To run Q-learning on wumpus without percepts with exploration function approach----
        Run qWumpus_Exploration_func.py file first, and simultaneously run liveplot.py through a new terminal tab. The former file, executes the RL algorithm, and
        simulataneous execution of liveplot.py will generate the scattered reward v/s episodes plot.
    
    ----To run Q-learning on wumpus with percepts, with epsilon-greedy approach----    
       The file to be excuted to run the algorithm and plot the reward v/s episode is qlearning_all_states.py. The qlearning-all_states.py
        and util.py should be in the same folder as the gym-wumpusworld folder.
